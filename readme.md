JAVA WAR CARD GAME: 
This project is a simple, automated version of the classic card game WAR, built entirely in Java. It demonstrates basic object-oriented programming principles by simulating a complete game from shuffling and dealing to determining the final winner.



HOW IT WORKS: 
The game logic is organized into four main classes:

Card.java: Represents a single playing card with a name (e.g., "Ace of Spades") and a value (2-14).

Deck.java: Represents a standard 52-card deck. It can be shuffled and drawn from.

Player.java: Represents a player, holding a hand of cards, a name, and a score.

App.java: The main application class that contains the main method to run the game. It initializes the deck and players, deals the cards, and manages the game flow.

The application runs automatically in the console, playing 26 rounds and declaring a winner based on the final score.



HOW TO RUN:
Clone or download the repository.

Open the project in a Java IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ.

Navigate to the App.java file.

Run the main method. The results of the game will be printed to the console.
